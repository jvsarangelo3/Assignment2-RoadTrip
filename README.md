# Assignment2-RoadTrip
Design and implement an application for scheduling road trips in the continental USA â€” 48 of thestates, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. Assume the user will supply a starting city (San Francisco, forexample) and an ending city (eg. Miami). In addition, the user will supply zero, one or more events orplaces of interest by name, such as the Grand Canyon, Paul Bunyon and Babe the Blue Ox inMinnesota or the Statue of Liberty in New York. Once implemented, your solution must find a routefrom the starting city to the ending city in a way that visits each of the events or places of interest whilekeeping the number of miles driven to a minimum. In the example from above, the solution must returna route from San Francisco through the following places, in order:
- Grand Canyon AZ
- Bemidji MN
- New York NY..., 
in that order, finally ending in Miami.

To run the program, simply follow instructions in the terminal.
Ex.) enter starting city, ending city, attractions, and 0 if you are finished with entering attractions when prompted.
The program will print the final route by city and the final distance in miles.
